      <p><!-- About You -->Hi, Iâ€™m Lokeshwar ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Applications (BCA) and Iâ€™m passionate about exploring the ever-evolving world of technology. As a tech enthusiast, I love diving into new tools, frameworks, and ideas that shape the modern digital landscape.

Beyond academics, I enjoy playing competitive video games like League of Legends, Valorant, and CS:GO. Gaming not only fuels my competitive spirit but also sharpens my problem-solving and teamwork skills.

Right now, Iâ€™m focused on building my technical foundation, learning new technologies, and working on projects that challenge me to think creatively. My goal is to grow as a developer and contribute to innovative solutions that make a difference.</p>
